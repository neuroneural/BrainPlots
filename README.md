# BrainPlots

This repository contains Python code used to conduct an extensive analysis on neuroimaging data, considering different models and their performance related to the concept of collision count.

## Description
The analysis is conducted in multiple Python scripts, each focusing on a different aspect of the data. The main themes considered in the analysis include:

Understanding the effect of removing the medial wall on the collision counts for different models. This is conducted by loading, processing, and visualizing the data from pickled files.

The models used in the analysis are:

- CortexODE
- CorticalFlow
- DeepCSR
- FreeSurfer
- Vox2Cortex
- Topofit
- PialNN

Each script outputs graphical representations of the data for better understanding and interpretation. All plots are saved in the directory.

Libraries Used
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
- pickle
- os

## Plot Description
Each script generates different kinds of plots to visualize the data:
There is a readme file under each figure folder.

## Instructions to Run
To run the scripts, you must have the appropriate libraries installed, as well as Python 3. You should be able to run them in a standard Python environment or a Jupyter notebook.

Note: Before running the scripts, make sure the required data files are in the same directory as the scripts.

## Contact
For any questions or concerns about the scripts, please contact the repository owner.
